# Harder Solar System
A set of Kopernicus configs that make the stock solar system more challenging. Comes in several size scales: 1x (stock), 2x, 3x, 4x.

## Changes to Stock
* The orbits of planets/moons are inclined to simulate a 23.4째 axial tilt for Kerbin, similar to how Real Solar System does it.
* KSC moved to a new location that has a latitude of 28.608389째 N.
* Mun's inclination changed to 5.145째 relative to Kerbin's orbit, like how the real Moon is. No more lunar/solar eclipses every Mun orbit.
* Minmus's inclination changed to 0.5째 relative to Kerbin's orbit. Changed so that it's inclination is not too similar to Mun's.
* Rotation periods are adjusted based on scale.
* Note: Potato moons do not scale with the various scales to retain their intended shape.

## Outer Planets Mod Compatibility
* Same as above regarding orbits for most. For now, Sarnus's inner moons retain the original orbit relative to Sarnus's equator/rings, which looks better.
* Same situation with the potato moons as above.

## Remote Tech Compatibility
* Mission Control ground station is moved to the new KSC location.
* Added three Deep Space Network ground stations.
* Added two short range stations to assist with launches.
* Antennas and ground stations all scale with the varied scales available.

#### Thanks
* Thanks to Paul Kingtiger for inspiration on several parts of this. Also, some compatibility came straight from KScale2.
* Thanks to NathanKell's RSS for inspiring the axial tilt simulation.

### Changelog
